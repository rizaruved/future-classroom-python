                    <!-- PYTHON HISTORY -->
                    <h4>A Brief History of Python</h4>

                    <p>
                        Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, and its development began in the late 1980s. The first official Python release, Python 0.9.0, came out in 1991. The language's name wasn't inspired by the snake; rather, it pays homage to Monty Python's Flying Circus, a British comedy group that Guido van Rossum enjoyed. Python's early design principles focused on readability and ease of use, aiming to provide a language that was both powerful and accessible.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Over the years, Python evolved and gained popularity due to its simplicity, versatility, and a supportive community. In 2000, Python 2 was released with new features, and it became widely adopted. However, as the language continued to grow, the developers realized the need for certain improvements and enhancements. This led to the introduction of Python 3 in 2008, which brought about changes to enhance the language's consistency and fix some design flaws.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite the transition from Python 2 to Python 3 causing some initial challenges, Python 3 has become the standard, and the community successfully migrated to the newer version. Python's popularity continued to soar in the 2010s, becoming one of the most widely used programming languages globally. Its readability and extensive libraries contributed to its adoption in various domains, including web development, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, Python remains a leading programming language, powering a multitude of applications and projects across industries. The open-source nature of Python encourages collaboration and innovation, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers.
